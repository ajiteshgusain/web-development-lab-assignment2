# Ajitesh Singh Gusain: Web Development Portfolio - Assignment 2 (Styled & Advanced Layout)
## Course: Robotics and AI, Section A | Subject: Web Development

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, which has been significantly upgraded from the initial version to utilize **external CSS** and demonstrate intermediate styling techniques. The site now features a refined visual design, responsive components, and adherence to a professional mock-up.

### 🚀 Project Goals & Key Demonstrations

The main goals of this project were enhanced in Assignment 2 to showcase:

* **Professional Styling:** Implementing a cohesive color theme (Deep Blue/White) and custom typography (Roboto font) via **External CSS (`style.css`)**.
* **Structured Layout:** Utilizing the **CSS Box Model (Margin & Padding)** to create the distinct, separated content blocks shown in the visual mock-up.
* **Advanced Positioning (CSS3):**
    * Implementing a **Sticky Navigation Bar** (`position: sticky`) for persistent access to site sections.
    * Adding a **"Back to Top" button** (`position: fixed`) for improved user experience.
* **Structured Data:** Creating a well-formatted and styled **Skills Table**, including border styling and consistent cell padding.
* **Form Design:** Structuring the contact form using a **table layout** to align with the design requirements.
